# Role-Based Menu and Action Button System Implementation

## Current Status
- ✅ HandleInertiaRequests middleware shares userPermissions and filters menuItems
- ✅ UserController has permission checks with own permission logic
- ✅ Users/Index.vue conditionally renders buttons based on permissions
- ✅ AppSidebar.vue accessing menuItems from correct props location (page.props.menuItems)
- ✅ MenuPermissionTest has correct assertions (userPermissions as array)
- ✅ UserManagementTest has comprehensive permission testing
- ✅ RoleAndPermissionSeeder creates all CRUD permissions for users model
- ✅ RoleMenuSeeder has proper menu items for different roles using firstOrCreate
- ✅ All 54 tests pass
- ✅ Debug code removed from Users/Index.vue
- ✅ Fixed duplicate menu items in sidebar (Dashboard, Users, Roles appearing multiple times)
- ✅ Fixed "Call to undefined method UserController::authorize()" error by replacing with proper permission checking

## Completed Tasks

### 1. AppSidebar.vue ✅
- ✅ Correct menuItems access from page.props.menuItems (not page.props.auth)
- ✅ No debug code present
- ✅ Proper icon mapping with fallback to LayoutGrid

### 2. MenuPermissionTest.php ✅
- ✅ userPermissions assertions expect array format
- ✅ menuItems assertions correctly check for presence/absence based on permissions
- ✅ Tests pass for admin and regular user scenarios

### 3. UserManagementTest.php ✅
- ✅ Comprehensive permission-based test scenarios for admin, manager, and user roles
- ✅ Tests own permission restrictions (regular user can only update own data)
- ✅ Tests button visibility through permission assertions
- ✅ Tests CRUD operations with proper authorization

### 4. RoleAndPermissionSeeder.php ✅
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Comprehensive permission scheme implemented
  - Basic CRUD: view, create, edit, delete
  - Own permissions: view own, edit own, delete own
  - Advanced: approve, publish, archive, restore, export, import
  - Management: manage, assign
  - Global: view dashboard, manage settings, access reports, view analytics, manage system, access admin panel, view logs, manage backups
- ✅ Manager role with enhanced permissions (user management, role management, reports access)
- ✅ User role with own permissions and basic access
- ✅ Admin role has all permissions

### 5. RoleMenuSeeder.php ✅
- ✅ Uses firstOrCreate for idempotency
- ✅ Proper menu items for admin (Dashboard, Users, Roles, Permissions)
- ✅ Proper menu items for manager (Dashboard, Users, Reports)
- ✅ Proper menu items for user (Dashboard, Profile)
- ✅ Menu items match assigned permissions

### 6. Test Integration ✅
- ✅ All 55 tests pass (including new permission scheme)
- ✅ Frontend menu visibility works correctly based on permissions
- ✅ Button visibility tested through permission checks
- ✅ Own permission restrictions properly enforced
- ✅ New permission scheme tested and working

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
- ✅ Admin sees all menus and buttons
- ✅ Manager sees limited menus/buttons based on permissions
- ✅ User sees only own data with restricted actions
- ✅ Own permissions properly enforced
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Frontend correctly shows/hides UI elements based on permissions

## Task: Fix Role-Based Access Control Issues ✅

### Problem
- Manager role with user permissions getting 403 error when accessing user page
- Admin role getting 403 error when accessing roles page
- Routes were restricted to only 'admin' role via middleware
- Controllers had inconsistent authorization (manual checks vs Policy-based)

### Solution
- Updated routes/web.php to use permission-based middleware instead of role-based
- Enabled wildcard permissions in config/permission.php
- Updated UserController to use Policy-based authorization for consistency
- Both controllers now use Policy system (RolePolicy, UserPolicy) for granular permission checks

### Changes Made
- config/permission.php: Enabled wildcard permissions
- routes/web.php: Changed from 'role:admin' to permission-based middleware
- app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php: Added AuthorizesRequests trait and Policy-based authorization

### Testing
- Manager role should now access user pages with their permissions
- Admin role should access both user and role pages with full permissions
- Permission-based access is scalable for new models

## Task: Make Route Permissions Automatic and Scalable ✅

### Problem
- Routes required manual middleware configuration for each new controller
- Adding new resource controllers needed manual permission middleware updates

### Solution
- Created custom middleware `CheckResourcePermission` that dynamically checks permissions based on route name
- Middleware extracts resource name from route (e.g., 'users' from 'users.index') and checks corresponding permission (e.g., 'view users')
- Registered middleware as 'resource.permission' in bootstrap/app.php
- Updated routes/web.php to use single middleware for all resource routes

### Changes Made
- app/Http/Middleware/CheckResourcePermission.php: New custom middleware for dynamic permission checking
- bootstrap/app.php: Registered 'resource.permission' middleware alias
- routes/web.php: Simplified to use single 'resource.permission' middleware for all resource routes

### Benefits
- **Automatic**: Any new resource controller added will automatically have permission checks
- **Scalable**: No need to manually add middleware for new models/controllers
- **Dynamic**: Permission checked based on route name pattern (resource.action)
- **Consistent**: Same permission pattern for all resources (view, create, edit, delete)

### Usage
When adding new resource controller, just add the route:
```php
Route::resource('newmodel', NewModelController::class);
```
The middleware will automatically check permissions like 'view newmodel', 'create newmodel', etc.
