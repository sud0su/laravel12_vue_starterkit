# Role-Based Menu and Action Button System Implementation

## Current Status
- ✅ HandleInertiaRequests middleware shares userPermissions and filters menuItems
- ✅ UserController has permission checks with own permission logic
- ✅ Users/Index.vue conditionally renders buttons based on permissions
- ✅ AppSidebar.vue accessing menuItems from correct props location (page.props.menuItems)
- ✅ MenuPermissionTest has correct assertions (userPermissions as array)
- ✅ UserManagementTest has comprehensive permission testing
- ✅ RoleAndPermissionSeeder creates all CRUD permissions for users model
- ✅ RoleMenuSeeder has proper menu items for different roles using firstOrCreate
- ✅ All 54 tests pass
- ✅ Debug code removed from Users/Index.vue
- ✅ Fixed duplicate menu items in sidebar (Dashboard, Users, Roles appearing multiple times)
- ✅ Fixed "Call to undefined method UserController::authorize()" error by replacing with proper permission checking

## Completed Tasks

### 1. AppSidebar.vue ✅
- ✅ Correct menuItems access from page.props.menuItems (not page.props.auth)
- ✅ No debug code present
- ✅ Proper icon mapping with fallback to LayoutGrid

### 2. MenuPermissionTest.php ✅
- ✅ userPermissions assertions expect array format
- ✅ menuItems assertions correctly check for presence/absence based on permissions
- ✅ Tests pass for admin and regular user scenarios

### 3. UserManagementTest.php ✅
- ✅ Comprehensive permission-based test scenarios for admin, manager, and user roles
- ✅ Tests own permission restrictions (regular user can only update own data)
- ✅ Tests button visibility through permission assertions
- ✅ Tests CRUD operations with proper authorization

### 4. RoleAndPermissionSeeder.php ✅
- ✅ All CRUD permissions created for users model (view, create, edit, delete, view own, edit own, delete own)
- ✅ Manager role with specific permissions (view users, edit users, view dashboard)
- ✅ User role with own permissions (view own users, edit own users, view dashboard)
- ✅ Admin role has all permissions

### 5. RoleMenuSeeder.php ✅
- ✅ Uses firstOrCreate for idempotency
- ✅ Proper menu items for admin (Dashboard, Users, Roles, Permissions)
- ✅ Proper menu items for manager (Dashboard, Users, Reports)
- ✅ Proper menu items for user (Dashboard, Profile)
- ✅ Menu items match assigned permissions

### 6. Test Integration ✅
- ✅ All 54 tests pass
- ✅ Frontend menu visibility works correctly based on permissions
- ✅ Button visibility tested through permission checks
- ✅ Own permission restrictions properly enforced

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
- ✅ Admin sees all menus and buttons
- ✅ Manager sees limited menus/buttons based on permissions
- ✅ User sees only own data with restricted actions
- ✅ Own permissions properly enforced
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Frontend correctly shows/hides UI elements based on permissions
